        <h2>About Me:</h2>
        <h3>Jake Barer</h3>
        <p>My name is Jake, and I'm an undergraduate at UC Berkeley double majoring in chemistry and data science. I am interested in
           using my computational and statistical skills in order to assist in drug research and discovery once I graduate. Relevant coursework
           includes Organic Chemistry (CHEM 12A and 12B), Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (CS 61A), Introduction to Probability
           and Statistics (STAT 20), Data Structures and Algorithms (CS 61B, currently taking), Principles and Techniques of Data Science (DATA 100, plannning to take),
           User Interface Design and Development (CS 160, planning to take), and Introduction to Machine Learning (CS 189, planning to take). In my free time,
           I enjoy cooking, baking, trying new food, and working out!</p>

        <h3>Ants vs SomeBees (Python)</h3>
        <p>I created a tower defense game using object oriented programming paradigms where "Ant" objects used both offensive and defensive class methods to defend from
           the "Bee" objects with methods to attack and move forward. Inheritance and method lookup were used to create different types of ants to make more interesting strategies.

        <h3>Scheme Interpreter (Python)</h3>
        <p>I created an interpreter of the language Scheme in Python by redirecting Scheme expressions and various syntax forms to the appropriate Python function calls.</p>

        <h3>Smash at Berkeley Website (HTML, CSS, in progress)</h3>
        <p>I created a website for Smash at Berkeley, a club in which I am an executive of. It was made to publicize the club to those who are not a part of it yet. Basic
            interactity such as anchors and slideshows were implemented, and CSS was used in order to make it more presentable.</p>
